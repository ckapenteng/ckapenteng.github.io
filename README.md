## Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models in Predicting Coronary Artery Disease

### I partnered with my colleague Mbye Sallah to work on this project together for our STATISTICAL COMPUTING final project at Ohio University.

#### Abstact

We evaluate and compare the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) models in predicting coronary artery disease (CAD). By applying five distinct classification techniques—Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest—we analyze and identify which model provides the most accurate predictions. Our project utilizes CAD data from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository.  We conduct a thorough analysis involving data preprocessing, model training, and model validation. Our evaluation focuses on several key performance metrics including accuracy rates, sensitivity, ROC, and Area Under Curve (AUC). We show that among these classifiers, the SVM performs better in terms of predictive accuracy, sensitivity, and AUC.
