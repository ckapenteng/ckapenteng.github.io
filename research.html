										<h3>Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models in Predicting Coronary Artery Disease</h3>
										<p>Collins Kwasi Apenteng & Mbye Sallah (May 2024)</p>
									</header>
									<p><b>Abstract</b><br>We evaluate and compare the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) models in predicting coronary artery disease (CAD). By applying five distinct classification techniques—Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest—we analyze and identify which model provides the most accurate predictions. Our project utilizes CAD data from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository.  We conduct a thorough analysis involving data preprocessing, model training, and model validation. Our evaluation focuses on several key performance metrics including accuracy rates, sensitivity, ROC, and Area Under Curve (AUC). We show that among these classifiers, the SVM performs better in terms of predictive accuracy, sensitivity, and AUC.</p>

										<h3>The impact of exchange rate stabilization policies on FDI inflows in Africa: Evidence from Ghana’s 2007 Redenomination Policy</h3>
										<p>Collins Kwasi Apenteng (April 2024)</p>
									</header>
									<p><b>Abstract</b><br>In July 2007, the Bank of Ghana announced the redenomination of the Ghana Cedi from ten thousand old Ghana cedis to one new Ghana cedi, making the cedi more valuable than a dollar in 2007. Among the expected benefits, the policy targeted foreign exchange stability, inflation reduction, and long-term international capital inflows that drive economic growth. I apply the two-way fixed effects difference-in-differences estimator to WDI data spanning 1992-2021 to examine the impact of the redenomination policy on FDI inflows in Ghana. I find that the average annual FDI inflows (as a percentage of GDP) increase by 4.7 percentage points (ppts) in the short run but reduce by 3.4 ppts in the long run. My findings suggest redenomination policies and foreign exchange interventions may not yield sustainable benefits for attracting long-term capital inflows. </p>

										<h3>The Impact of Real Interest Rate Volatility on Capital Formation in Developing and Emerging Market Economies</h3>
										<p>Collins Kwasi Apenteng (April 2024)</p>
									</header>
									<p><b>Abstract</b><br>Theoretical literature unambiguously postulates a negative relationship between real interest rate levels and investment. This has received wide empirical support. However, real interest rate volatility and investment nexus have not been adequately explored. Using WDI and IMF data on 45 developing and emerging market economies, I find that real interest volatility has an ambiguous effect on capital formation under different GMM specifications. Instead, trade openness and the level of real interest rate have unique and robust effects on capital formation across different specifications. My findings have implications for monetary policies that target investment through the interest rate.</p>
